ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
In this project I created a simple game inspired by the Odyssey by Homer. The game contains of a interactive game board for two players of 100 tiles, where each player gets 50 tiles each. The goal is to reach the end of the board (Ithaca) as quick as possible while also of course staying alive. There are many islands o nthe board where players will fight battles versus island enemies. There is also a chance for battles with epic enemies which are more powerful than the island enemies. Along the way you will also run into things such as chests locked by riddles and special tiles that might affect your stats. I hope you guys find this game fun and playeable.
